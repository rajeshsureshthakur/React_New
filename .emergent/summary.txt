The AI engineer successfully built a React frontend and a FastAPI backend for the CQE Project Management dashboard. Initial work focused on a robust design system, followed by the creation of a clean login page, registration, and a dashboard with Zephyr/Jira tabs. Key decisions included using mock data initially, then integrating with MongoDB for real user registration and dashboard data. Debugging involved fixing React  component issues, ensuring proper state management, and resolving backend Oracle DB setup (mocked for this environment). The project evolved from a UI prototype to a functional application with user management and dynamic content based on selected projects and releases, emphasizing design principles throughout.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a React-based CQE Project Management dashboard and analytics application.
**Phase 1 (Initial Prototype):**
*   **Login Page:** CQE Project Management header, SOEID (2 letters + 5 digits), Passcode (4-digit), Forgot Passcode link, Register button.
*   **Dashboard (Post-Login):** CQE Project Management branding in Navbar, Zephyr and Jira tabs (Zephyr default), Account section (Change Passcode, Change Role, Sign Out).
*   **Sidebar (Zephyr Tab):** Initially, background disabled with a mandatory popup to select Project (dropdown, random options) and Zephyr Release (dropdown based on project). Once selected, enable main page and fetch data for all tabs. Sidebar options: Create Release, Manage Release Data (expandable: Import requirements, Map requirements, Create Test case, Import Bulk testcases, Manage Cycles & Phases, Update execution Status, Import Regression testcases, Update Central test repo), View my BOW, View My teams BOW, Release Summary view, View capability metrics, Configure confluence.
*   **Registration Screen:** SOEID (e.g., AB12345), Full name, Passcode (4 digit), Zephyr Token, Jira Token. On Zephyr Token entry, call backend API (mock Zephyr API) to list projects; user selects one. Tooltips for tokens (Please get [Zephyr/Jira] token from [Zephyr/Jira] portal).
*   **Dashboard Enhancements:** Dashboard tiles (Total Projects, Total Releases, Total Users, Total Testcases - from  table), Active cycles, Requirements. Left panel: Select Project (showing  IDs for logged-in user), Select Release (based on selected project). Create Release enabled after project selection. Other left-panel buttons disabled until project/release selected.
*   **Create Release Form:** New Release Name (text), Build/Jira Release (text), Start Date/End Date (editable date fields with pickers), Want to use previous release folder structure? (Yes/No, if Yes, ask previous Build Release), How many Phases? (Load Test, Endurance Test, Sanity Test, Standalone Test - integer text boxes). Create Release button. Endpoint for Create Release (mock Zephyr API call) to save data (release_id, release_name, project_id, date) in releases table.

**Backend/Database:**
*   Initially no backend/DB, then full stack with FastAPI.
*   MongoDB integration for user registration, login, and data storage.
*    table required for Testcases tile.
*   Backend API endpoints for Zephyr sidebar options.
*   Configuration for future Oracle DB integration (with mock setup).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui primitives.

**High-Level Architecture:**
The application follows a standard React frontend and FastAPI backend structure. The frontend handles UI/UX and API calls, while the backend manages API endpoints, database interactions (MongoDB), and authentication. A clear separation of concerns is maintained with dedicated directories for components, pages, routes, and utilities.

**Key Files and Changes:**

*   :
    *   **Summary:** Core design system. Defines semantic HSL color tokens, custom gradients, shadows, and animations. Crucial for consistent, themable UI.
    *   **Changes:** Heavily customized to establish the design system philosophy.
*   :
    *   **Summary:** Configures Tailwind CSS to use the custom design tokens defined in .
    *   **Changes:** Modified to extend Tailwind with the custom HSL variables.
*   :
    *   **Summary:** The main React application entry point, handling routing and global layout.
    *   **Changes:** Updated to include routes for , , and , conditionally rendering  or .
*   :
    *   **Summary:** Provides the user interface for login, including SOEID, Passcode, and links to register/forgot passcode.
    *   **Changes:** Initially mock, updated to integrate with backend authentication API and link to .
*   :
    *   **Summary:** Implements the user registration form.
    *   **Changes:** Created with various input fields (SOEID, Name, Passcode, Zephyr Token, Jira Token), client-side validation, dynamic project selection based on Zephyr token validation, and integration with the backend registration API. Form layout optimized for compactness.
*   :
    *   **Summary:** The main dashboard view after successful login, containing the , , and main content area ( or ).
    *   **Changes:** Modified to remove the initial mandatory , fetch and display real data on dashboard tiles, and conditionally render .
*   :
    *   **Summary:** Originally a mandatory modal for project and release selection after login.
    *   **Changes:** Modified to refine  component usage, then completely removed from the initial dashboard flow as per new requirements.
*   :
    *   **Summary:** Renders the left-hand navigation, including Zephyr and Jira tabs and their respective menu items.
    *   **Changes:** Updated to include project and release dropdowns. Implements logic to disable most menu items until a project and release are selected, except for Create Release. Also handles the click event for Create Release to show the form.

- Implement the logic to enable all left-panel buttons in the  after a project and release are selected.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the Create Release functionality.
This involved:
1.  **Creating **: This new frontend component contains all the required input fields for creating a new release:
    *   New Release Name (text)
    *   Build/Jira Release (text)
    *   Start Date and End Date (editable date fields with date pickers, showing current date by default)
    *   Want to use previous release folder structure? (Yes/No radio buttons, with a conditional previous Build Release text box)
    *   How many Phases you want to create for Load Test, Endurance Test, Sanity Test, and Standalone Test (integer text boxes).
    *   A Create Release button.
2.  **Updating **: To dynamically show the  on the right side when the Create Release option is selected from the sidebar.
3.  **Updating **: The  component is being updated to:
    *   Handle the click event for Create Release.
    *   Ensure that Create Release is the only enabled button in the left panel initially, until a project and release are selected.
    *   Pass the selected project ID to the  for use in the backend API call.

The backend has a  endpoint ready (mocked for now) to be called by this form. The database ( table in MongoDB) is set up to store the , , , and Sat Oct 25 13:23:07 UTC 2025 fields upon successful creation.

The last action taken was: Now update the Sidebar to handle Create Release click and only enable it when project is selected: which indicates the  update is currently in progress.
